blueprint:
  name: Import Garbage Collection from txt
  description: >-
    This automation is triggered from the `garbage_collection` integration by event `garbage_collection_loaded`,
    during the device state update. 

    It PROCESSES DATA SENT WITH THE EVENT, and then FINISHES THE UPDATE.
    DO NOT CALL THIS SERVICE MANUALLY, IT WON'T WORK (it won't have the data).

    Also, make sure the INTEGRATION IS CONFIGURED FOR `manual_update`
    (that will disable the state update by the integration and pass it to this automation).


    It imports dates from a txt file containing colection dates, one date per line.
    To read the file, you will need to create a `command_line` sensor reading the file content (see below).


    The sensors are normally updated once a day, or when Home Assistant starts.
    The update can be triggered by updating the integration configuration (just hit configure and submit).

        To import dates from the file /share/import.txt, create the sensor with `command: "cat /share/import.txt"`.
        Then, create a `blank` garbage_collection entity configured with `manual_update`,
        and configure an automation with this blueprint to link the two entities.
