blueprint:
  name: Include dates
  description: >-
    This automation is triggered from the `garbage_collection` integration by event `garbage_collection_loaded`,
    during the device state update. 

    It PROCESSES DATA SENT WITH THE EVENT, and then FINISHES THE UPDATE.
    DO NOT CALL THIS SERVICE MANUALLY, IT WON'T WORK (it won't have the data).

    Also, make sure the INTEGRATION IS CONFIGURED FOR `manual_update`
    (that will disable the state update by the integration and pass it to this automation).

    Add events on a set of additional dates. Enter one date per line. For example:

    2022-01-03

    2022-04-04

    2022-07-04

    2022-10-03

    After updating the list, make sure to trigger the entity update. 
    The sensors are normally updated once a day, or when Home Assistant starts.
    The update can be triggered by updating the integration configuration (just hit configure and submit).
