    description: "Please provide a clear and concise description of what the bug is, including the steps to reproduce.
    Include screenshots to illustrate the issus.

    If this is an issue with the sensor state or translation, please go to Developer Tools/States, 
    find the entity under Current entities, click on the sensor's (i) icon and check the status in the right top corner. 
    
    The issues related to status are usually related to the Lovelace config, not the actual sensor state. So this will save both of us lots of time."
